# lasso
                                     PROJECT  DESCRIPTION FILE
A basic lasso game using c++ commands
This repositiory contains the basic version devoloped by cs101 course team under proffesor *Bhaskaran Raman & Kameshwari Chebrolu* of IIT BOMBAY
The improvements and the advanced version are created by me as a part of the course project of cs101.
 
Some initial changes:
1)The yank function is increasing the number of coins in such a way that after holding coin if we press yank continuously many times coins get increased by that many times.
2)I have changed the initial colour of the main coin.
3)I have changed the colour of lassoline to yellow.  
Improvements made:
1)A password based system to generate a personalizes competition for lasso
2)A database system to store details of each participant who entered in competition.
3)Separate competition and practice modes generated
4)In level 1 everything I set to default as given by game-makers .
4)In level 2 two coins are generated one that goes straight and second one that goes             in parabola ( (: ACTUALLY THIS IS NOT A LEVEL IN GENRAL SENSE AS IT GIVES YOU CHANCE TO SCORE MORE POINTS (:)
5)In level 3 two coins and bomb also going in parabola appears.
6)In level 4 everything remains same just here you get a time of 70 units (roughly 7 falltime of coin)
